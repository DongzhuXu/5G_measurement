# Introduction of 5G measurement dataset
----------

We perform extensive investigation over 5G networks via both active and passive measurements through 7 months. 

## Data format
Here we open **3 types of datasets** collected during our measurement.
 
(i) XCAL-Mobile logs of roadtest, handoff analysis and RRC state switching. This dataset is used in Sec. 3 ("5G coverage") and Sec. 6 ("5G smartphone energy consumption"). It is worth noting that XCAL-Mobileâ€™s file format (.drm/.drx) must be parsed by XCAP-Mobile, of which using tutorial can be seen in https://github.com/piaobozaizai/5G_measurement/blob/master/measurement%20tools/README.md

(ii) Packet trace of UDP/TCP performance, RTT measurement and video stream diagnosis. This dataset is used in Sec. 4 ("End-to-end throughput and delay") and Sec. 5 ("Application performance").

(iii) Power trace of power consumption. This dataset is used in Sec. 6 ("5G smartphone energy consumption").


## Statement
Due to the limited storage space of the Git repository, we only list a few data-trace files in each sub-folder. We have released the complete dataset in:
