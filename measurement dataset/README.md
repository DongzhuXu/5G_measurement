# Introduction of the 5G measurement dataset
----------

We perform extensive investigation over the 5G networks via both active and passive measurements through 7 months. 

## Data format
Here we open **3 types of datasets** collected during our measurement.
 
(i) XCAL-Mobile logs of roadtest, handoff analysis, and RRC state switching. This dataset is used in Sec. 3 ("5G coverage") and Sec. 6 ("5G smartphone energy consumption"). 
**It is worth noting that XCAL-Mobileâ€™s file format (.drm/.drx) must be parsed by XCAP-Mobile.** 

(ii) Packet trace of UDP/TCP performance analysis, RTT measurement, and video stream diagnosis. This dataset is used in Sec. 4 ("End-to-end throughput and delay") and Sec. 5 ("Application performance").

(iii) Power trace of power consumption. This dataset is used in Sec. 6 ("5G smartphone energy consumption").


## Statement
Due to the limited storage space of the Git repository, we open these datasets in:
