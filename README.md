We expect these tools and dataset can help other researchers on further work of understanding and optimizing 5G from different perspectives. 

# Outline
Our open source includes: 

1. A series of 5G measurement tools. 
2. Dataset traces collected by our measurement tools. Specifically,

	(i) Traces from XCAL-Mobile, which are used in Sec. 3 ("5G coverage") and Sec. 6 ("5G smartphone energy consumption"). 
	
	(ii) Packet traces from Wireshark, iperf3 and traceroute, which are used in Sec. 4 ("End-to-end throughput and delay") and Sec. 5 ("Application performance").
	
	(iii) Power consumption traces from pwrStrip, which are utilized in Sec. 6("5G smartphone energy consumption").

**Note that please refer to the README.md in each folder for detailed tutorials on using the measurement tools and dataset.**
