Dongzhu Xu, Anfu Zhou, Xinyu Zhang, GuixianWang, Xi Liu, Congkai An, Yiming Shi, Liang Liu, Huadong Ma. 2020. Understanding Operational 5G: A First Measurement Study on Its Coverage, Performance and Energy Consumption. *In Annual conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication on the applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication (SIGCOMM ’20), August 10–14, 2020, Virtual Event, NY, USA.* ACM, New York, NY, USA, 16 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3387514.3405882

We expect this release can help other researchers further understand and optimize the 5G networks. 

# Outline
Our open source includes: 

1. A series of 5G measurement tools. 
2. Traces collected from our measurement tools. Specifically,

	(i) XCAL-Mobile traces, which are used in Sec. 3 ("5G coverage") and Sec. 6 ("5G smartphone energy consumption"). 
	
	(ii) Packet traces from Wireshark, iperf3 and traceroute, which are used in Sec. 4 ("End-to-end throughput and delay") and Sec. 5 ("Application performance").
	
	(iii) Power traces from pwrStrip, which are utilized in Sec. 6("5G smartphone energy consumption").

**Note that please refer to the README.md in each sub-folder for detailed tutorials on the measurement tools and dataset.**
